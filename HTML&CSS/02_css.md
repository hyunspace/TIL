* The **selector points to the HTML element you want to style**.
* The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
* Each declaration includes **a CSS property name and a value**, separated by a colon.
  * property: which one's style
  * value: how to style
* Multiple CSS declarations are **separated with semicolons**, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

### Three Ways to Insert CSS

* Inline CSS: apply a unique style for a single element

* Internal CSS: Embedding `<style>`
* External CSS: Each HTML page must include a reference to **the external style sheet file** inside the `<link>` element, inside the head section.
